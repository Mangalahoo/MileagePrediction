# Mileage Prediction

This project predicts the mileage (fuel efficiency) of vehicles based on various factors using machine learning models. The goal is to help users estimate the mileage of a car by analyzing key attributes such as engine size, weight, and other features. The project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to solve regression problems in the automotive domain.

## Introduction
**Mileage Prediction** uses machine learning techniques to predict vehicle mileage (miles per gallon - MPG) based on various attributes. The project showcases the use of regression models to solve a real-world problem related to fuel efficiency.

## Features
- Predict vehicle mileage based on features such as engine size, weight, horsepower, etc.
- Demonstrates the use of regression models for prediction.
- Provides a step-by-step approach for data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mangalahoo/MileagePrediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd MileagePrediction
    ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies using `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Open the Jupyter notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook MileagePrediction.ipynb
    ```

## Usage

1. After opening the Jupyter notebook (`MileagePrediction.ipynb`), run the cells step by step to see how the model is built and tested.
2. The notebook walks you through:
   - Data loading and cleaning.
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
   - Feature engineering.
   - Model training and testing.
3. Once the model is trained, you can input your own vehicle data to predict its mileage.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains attributes of various vehicles, including:
- Engine size
- Weight
- Horsepower
- Number of cylinders
- Model year
- Fuel type

The dataset is processed to prepare it for building machine learning models, including handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

## Modeling
The project employs several regression models to predict vehicle mileage, including:
- **Linear Regression**: A simple yet effective regression technique.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: A more complex model that leverages decision trees.
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**: An advanced model for improving prediction accuracy.
  
The models are evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to assess their performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and EDA.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and demonstrating the project.
